# Work tracking for Azure DevOps content

The Azure DevOps content team plans and tracks their work in Azure Boards on the following backlogs and boards: 
- [Azure DevOps Features backlog](https://dev.azure.com/mseng/TechnicalContent/Azure%20DevOps/_backlogs/backlog/Azure%20DevOps/Features?showParents=false)  
- [Azure DevOps User Stories backlog](https://dev.azure.com/mseng/TechnicalContent/Azure%20DevOps/_backlogs/backlog/Azure%20DevOps/Stories?showParents=false)  
- [Azure DevOps User Stories board](https://dev.azure.com/mseng/TechnicalContent/_boards/board/t/Azure%20DevOps/Stories)  

We track significant work for documenting new scenarios and tasks, and changes to the UI and feature support. We also review and update content to support accessibility, SEO, and general content freshness. 

> [!TIP]  
> If you are adding new content or making significant changes, please include a member of the content team on this work to avoid duplication and to align with ongoing content strategies. You can find the member of the content team who oversees a specific content area in [Azure DevOps repositories, content areas, content owners](/azure-devops-content-areas-and-owners.md). Or email the [Azure DevOps content team](mailto:AzDevContentDev@microsoft.com).
